# SolidStart

F1 Dashboard powered by Solid.js
Everything you need to build a Solid project, powered by [`solid-start`](https://start.solidjs.com);

## Clone repository

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/0hscar/f1dashboard.git
```

## Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or yarn etc etc
```

## Run locally

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Solid apps are built with _presets_, which optimise your project for deployment to different environments.

By default, `npm run build` will generate a Node app that you can run with `npm start`. To use a different preset, add it to the `devDependencies` in `package.json` and specify in your `app.config.js`.

## This project was created with the [Solid CLI](https://solid-cli.netlify.app)
